except that often in the Wyvern Clan, names didn't equalize them! we know Desdemona and probably many other Clan members refered to Goliath as, "leader" and probably did the same to Hudson before him, i'm sure they also called Demona and Goliath before her "second in command". having everyone more or less nameless except for the leader and his/her second in command didn't make them equal, it drew a line between those gargs in power and those not. of course, i'm probably exaggerating this a bit for sake of argument. it does make me think of another question. how do gargoyle socio-politics work? we know that the Clan Leader chooses his/her Second who becomes Leader and so on, but can the Clan have a say in Leader? can they impeach a Leader or Second they don't trust or is there ever a vote? also we need to remember that the individual gargoyle cultures are probably as varied as the human cultures they neighbor. in 994 the Wyvern Clan may be as different to the Ishimuran Clan as the people of Scotland and Japan were during that time... so Clan politics and naming issues may be very different from clan to clan. the English and Ishimuran Clans sound like they've been using names for a long time, but the Mayan Clan only has names for the 4 Pendant Wearers... naming is cultural. matt Tuesday, November 5, 2002 08:40:51 AM IP: 207.230.48.29
