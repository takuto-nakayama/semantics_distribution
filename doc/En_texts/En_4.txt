a reprint of a question i posted to Greg once: matt writes... i think i figured out when and how Xanatos found out the gargoyles lived in the Clocktower i don't think Xanatos found out the gargs lived in the Clocktower in Hunters Moon for several reasons. 1) i can't see either Owen or Puck just slipping up like that. 2) Fox and Xanatos just took it way too casually as if they had known for some time. after viewing some episodes, i'm convinced that Xanatos found out nearly a year before Hunters Moon, possibly before Owen/Puck knew. i think he found out in Eye of the Beholder. heres my reasons. 1) Xanatos places another tracking device on Goliath and then does not remove it for probably at LEAST an hour. 2) when Goliath leaves the castle he takes Elisa with him and in that time Elisa changes into her costume. her costume is probably at one of three places, at her apartment, in her car, or at the police station. if it was at the police station where she put on the costume then Xanatos only has to track them that far and he can figure out the rest (remember that Xanatos was probably tailing them for as much as he could, he may have even snuck into the Clocktower and seen the gargs furnishings).
